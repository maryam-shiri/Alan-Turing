        <h2>Early Life and Parents</h2>
        <p>Hailing from London, Cumberbatch was born with theater in his blood. His parents, Timothy Carlton and Wanda Ventham, were well-known television actors when they had their son on July 19, 1976. <br>
           Despite their success, they tried to steer young Benedict away from the stage and sent him to Harrow public school, where he had been awarded an arts scholarship. <br>
           At Harrow, he displayed an interest in rugby and painting, but it was theater that captured his imagination. Under the mentorship of Martin Tyrrell, Cumberbatch's first role was as Titania, <br>
           Queen of the Faeries, in William Shakespeare's A Midsummer's Night Dream.
           Cumberbatch went on to teach English in Darjeeling, before returning to England to study drama at the University of <br>
           Manchester. After graduation, he spent a year at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.</p>

        <h2>Personal Life</h2>
        <p>Cumberbatch dated Olivia Poulet on and off for many years before calling it quits for good in 2011. The pair had met at the University of Manchester. <br>
            In November 2014 Cumberbatch became engaged to director Sophie Hunter. The under-the-radar and understated announcement ran in England’s Times newspaper. <br>
             The couple tied the knot on February 14, 2015, on the Isle of Wight and welcomed their first child, son Christopher Carlton, that June. Two years later they welcomed the birth of their second son, Hal Auden. <br>
            In 2015 the actor was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In June 2018 reports surfaced of an incident from the previous fall in which Cumberbatch leaped from a cab to defend a bicycle <br>
            deliveryman from four muggers. Ironically, the Sherlock Holmes star found himself fighting crime near the location of the fictional detective's home on London's Baker Street. </p>
